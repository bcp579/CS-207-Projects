# Laser Security System

This Laser Security System is all about a smart security system. There should be no compromise with the security. So, this system provides services including emergency lighting, buzzer alarm alert, ON-OFF Switch for the security system and the most importantly it provides the message alert service. This security work on the laser security that all the jewellery showrooms can use it to keep their jewellery safe from thieves. This system will notified the owner by sending an email if someone tries to stole the ornaments from the restricted area and it will make the present people aware in the showroom by ringing the burglars and flashing the emergency light. As my security system is at the small level and works with the Arduino kit. So, my coompleted project looks like below picture.

# Build Instructions
To build the hardware section more easily. Here is the 3D Breadboard view of my Laser Security System given below:


# Usage
The following few steps you should do:
Upload the given Arduino code to the Arduino IDE.
Then Python code......
Build and the set the circuit by following the Bulid instruction.
Start the laser
Now your Security System is ready to protect the area!!!!!
